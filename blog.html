                    </div>    
                    <p class="post_content">A project named ‘Rennes 1 Campus 2030’ is a vast plan that is supposed to last for at least ten years
                        to fifteen years and cost approximately 450 million euros wich is roughly 538 million pounds sterling. The goal is to have
                        a better overall energetic efficiency, for example, consume less energy to heat the buildings, and for this they need to
                        make better wall and ceiling insulation to keep the heat inside and avoid unnecessary heating, especially the oldest
                        buildings since some of them where made in the sixties and others in the seventies. They hope to split the bill of 
                        energy consumption by 75% (electricity, water, gaz, etc ), which is a huge thing because the oldest buildings are 
                        really not in good shape, from my point of view of a student of Rennes 1, especially one of the amphitheater on the 
                        Beaulieu campus, it can be very cold in there during the winter. One the first step in this project is to start by the 
                        faculty of medicine near the CHU (university hospital center), which is allegedly supposed to start in 2023 and end in 
                        2024, it will be seven of the oldest buildings. And the buildings of the campus of Beaulieu, the number 01 to 07 where 
                        already done in autumn of 2021. The buildings that are going to be renovated on the campus of Beaulieu are the buildings 
                        number 22 to 27 as of the 14A and 15. As I am writing this in the early of march, the building number 38 is in renovation 
                        (the amphitheaters near the exam building and the building number 26), and supposed to end in the end of the summer of the 
                        year 2022. This project is a good thing for the environment, as one of the project voted by the students and the staff one 
                        year ago to plant 900 trees on the campus (with the help of MiniBigForest an organization from Nantes).

                    </div>
                    <p class="post_content">As you may know, planes are an ecological catastrophe. It is the most polluting means of transport that exists.
                        Aviation represents about 2% of greenhouse gas emissions of the entire world. Taking into account the average filling
                        rate and the distance travelled, the plane emits approximately 125 times more carbon dioxide than an individual
                        car and 1500 times more than a train. In addition to CO2, planes also release ozone, a greenhouse gas, and cirrus 
                        clouds (upper atmosphere clouds) which have a warming effect. However, planes are extremely useful for moving 
                        quickly anywhere in the world. That's why some airline companies are already trying to make planes fly without 
                        emitting CO2. Among them, the company Swiss International Air Lines plans to use a brand new fuel that will not
                        emit CO2 by 2023 : the synfuel solar kerosene. This fuel is created from sunlight and ambient air, which explains
                        why it does not emit CO2. Moreover this fuel is used like kerosene so it is not necessary to developpe new motors.
                        In France, an 800 million euro project has been launched to develop carbon-free planes. The goal is develop 
                        a hybrid electric or hydrogen powered plane that will be operationnal in 2030.

                        like this the oceans could contain more plastic than fish by 2050. It affects all marine fauna, animals mistake small 
                        plastic fragments with food, which can lead to poisoning and cost them their lives. Also, floating waste moves in the 
                        currents and it promotes the transport of invasive species: molluscs or algae attaches themselves to this waste and end up 
                        thousands of kilometers from their place of origin. It affects fishing, the largest waste, ends up trapped in fishing nets.

                    <p class="post_content">As everyone knows there is multiple ways to make energy and more precisely electricity, but all are not equal, sustainable or even safe. So, in this not exhaustive and not pretentious essay, we will quickly go over the mains productions sources of electricity around the Globe, explains what they are, clear some misconceptions, the pros and cons, theirs usages and theirs actual necessity. And will we also wonder about what would be the best plan regarding the matter going forward? To do that, we will firstly talk about the fossils energies which will be followed by a part on the renewable energies.

                        The fossils energies viewed as the bane of our little blue planet, a sword of Damocles that is already down our neck.

                        <p class="post_content">
                        First, let’s talk about coal, coal has been used for many different things like to fuel a fire or to throw in the mouth of a locomotive that would let you traverse the country back in the 1800s. But now we will focus on its use in the production of electricity, since the 19 centuries, coal was used in the production of electricity and in 2016 coal-fired power plant were still approximately representing 40% of the world electricity production. Coal is slowly getting abandoned as the years flew by, mainly due to two reasons: The environmental crisis that it represent and the better options that had arisen with time, but it still represent 36,7% of the overall production. Yes, coal-fired power plant are one of the main primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions. However, they are still plenty of coal to mine and one of the main exporter that is Australia still has plenty much to spare, the world’s reserve would last approximately 132 years with the current rate. It’s also notable to say that it’s a production that is always accessible as long as there is coal.

                        <p class="post_content">
                        Then we will be covering gas, gas has been around for quite some time already, since it’s was used in China in 4th century BC. J.-C. as a combustible and source of light and then back in 1785 was introduced in Europe as a source of light and heat. As a primary source of energy, ever since the 1960s, the shares of the production has grown to become the third main production with 23,2% for the general energy production and 23,5% for the production of electricity in 2019. The mains producers of gas in the world are the USA(23,7%) and Russia(16,6%). In regards of the current geopolitical situation, we can see the importance of gas and the lack of options that the countries that relies on it have if problems such as, for example, war with one of the mains producers. Even if  
                        the amount of the gas on Earth is still unclear, the countries that currently have the mains reserves on theirs territory are Russia, Iran and Qatar, those three have more than 50% of the world’s reserve. The reserves of gas are estimated to last nearly 50 years. And aside from the greenhouse gas emissions it creates, the exploitation of gas is also a danger for the ecosystem because as the gas field are deep underground, the simple act to reach the gas can be a cause of earthquake and the methods of extractions can make the gas to leak which because those gas are acid.

                        </p>
                        <p class="post_content">
                        Yes, it might be surprising to some, but the nuclear is (as of now) a fossil energy, mainly due to the fact that what it need to work, the uranium, is not infinite but the accessible reserves would last for 135 years. The mains producer of uranium are the Kazakhstan, the Canada, Australia, Niger and Namibia. The nuclear energy is bound to some fascinating physical and mathematical concepts but we will have to pass it as it is not the subject of this essay; but everyone knows the bombs of WWII, Chernobyl and Fukushima, while nobody died because of the nuclear incident of Fukushima (except for one disappearance that could be attributed to it) it is still a tragic environmental event, the other two events were both tragic on the human plan and environmental plan, but they need context to not succumb to the fear: the bombs were weapon used in times of war and it is now more of a threat than an actual possible thing to happen, Chernobyl was a human error with proper care it would have not happen and with today technology this type of accident is almost impossible and then the accident of Fukushima was caused by both an earthquake and a tsunami, naturals disasters that does not occur everywhere. On the bright side, nuclear energy is one of the sources of electricity that produces the less greenhouse gas, the only carbon dioxide that is emit is the transportation of the necessities for the power plant.
                        But there are the nuclear waste problem, even if those should now be treated and taken cared of properly they would be for at least a few centuries in concrete coffin to lose theirs radioactivity.

                        <p class="post_content">
                        As seen, some of the fossils energies are the mains emitters of greenhouse gas but they can produces relatively whenever. However, they will not be there forever, so in a century we will be forced to produces electricity without them but what are the sustainable option for the very long term then?

                        Viewed by some as the savior of the earth and the absolute good, renewable energies are energies that are essentially infinite, they are not bound by a fixed stock stored on the planet, they used the forces that nature proposed for the longest time but something that seems like a godsend should have downside otherwise they would have been used everywhere right?

                        <p class="post_content">
                        Before wind mill could grind grains, now they can generates electricity. Using the wind, wind turbines creates electricity, and since there will always be windy days, there’s now a reason to like those annoying days. What’s more, they emits no carbon dioxide and can be placed on land and on the sea. But since there’s always a catch to something good, where is it? Well, for starters, it’s an intermittent energy because there’s days with no wind which means that no electricity is generated and days like this can last weeks and this is a problem when electricity is needed. Then, a single wind turbine doesn’t generate a lot, so a whole bunch is needed and they can take a huge surface, which kinda spoil the landscape, hurt the environment and the ecosystem because concrete is needed in the soil for them to stay in place and the new models only last for about 30 years (up to around 50 if taken cared off properly) this makes all the ancient wind turbines to be replaced in a few years from now.

                        </p>
                        <p class="post_content">
                        In ancient times, people used to attribute the sun and the thunder to different gods (most likely for balance otherwise they would have been to OP),  but solar panels are a proof that the two can go well together. The sun, one of the absolute necessities to life can now creates electricity that will leads to the destruction of said life (maybe, and the sun can actually fulfill that role pretty well if you think about it). There’s multiple types of solar panel like the photovoltaic panels or the thermal solar panels which respectively use the rays of light and the heat that produces those rays to creates electricity. Places like the Sahara are ideal for those kind of technologies considering the extreme heat and sunlight there is, but even in places like France it’s still profitable. But, just like the wind turbines, a single solar panel doesn’t produce much, so to make up for it need a lot of space, in places like the Sahara it’s relatively alright even considering the biodiversity of the desert but in place like China where, as seen on some pictures, mountains were covered by solar panels makes you ask whether it’s is really alright for the ecosystem (without even talking about the landscape). And also those panels need light which means that they don’t work much on cloudy days and don’t work at all at night and taking again the example of China, the question of their longevity and “afterlife” is brought, because in 30 years they would need either dispose or replace those panels

                        Hydro-electric energy is essentially just a water mill that creates electricity but while it seems rather simple, it is extremely effective, so much that it’s the renewable energy that produces the most electricity around the world. There’s just a few problems with it: One, it requires water, and a lot of water, in a form of river for example which makes it impossible to use everywhere; Two, it’s costly, this super water mill is in a form of a dam after all so you can see the size of it and it’s not hard to understand why a lot of money is necessary; Three, since it’s a dam the water will be blocked and everything behind it will be drowned under the huge amount of water, whether it be villages, forest or any kind of lifeforms, which is a thing you definitely want to considerate if you don’t want people to wake up with their feet in the water and destroy the local ecosystem.

                        And finally, the geothermal energy, it use the heat the planet produces naturally to create steam and then electricity. It produces an eighth of the carbon dioxide so it is much better for the environment in that aspect but the downside are quite consequent: first it requires extreme heat found only in place like volcano so it’s not possible to put it everywhere, then it’s rather costly with 20% of failure and then it’s can also be cause of earthquakes.

                        So, renewable energies to save the planet and the ozone layer are forced to destroy environment? Well, not exactly but that’s kind of the idea that comes up when you take everything into consideration, they are either too ineffective for the current at the moment or too situational to be used everywhere. However, the current situation of the planet is rather critical and things need to be done and renewable energies are definitely something to consider and develop seriously.

                        Conclusion
                        </p>
                        <p class="post_content">
                        To conclude, things are complicated on one side, some of the electricity are a threat to the environment well being, 27% of the greenhouse gas emissions are from the production of electricity and should be stopped before the consequences are too severe, but on the other side, the society need electricity to function and the “green” ways of production are either pushing the problem elsewhere and later or are not fully reliable. But how countries are making the choices between those options? Let’s non shamelessly take two similar country on every aspect, one good student and one bad student, France and Germany, France has chosen has a main source of electricity the nuclear energy (70,6%) and complete it with renewable energies (21,1%) and the 8,3% left are from non renewable energies; while Germany has chosen to discard nuclear energy and chose to focus on renewable energies like wind turbines and solar panel which forced, Germany, on bad days with little winds and sunshine (and at night) to used their gas and coal fired power plant to produces electricity which emits a lot of greenhouse gas and this can be seen on real time with electricitymap.org, on average Germany produces three times more greenhouse gas than France.
                        In my opinion, they didn’t make the right call and should have kept theirs nuclear power plant while still pushing the renewable energies like they are doing now.
