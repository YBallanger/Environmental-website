                    <p class="post_content">A project named ‘Rennes 1 Campus 2030’ is a vast plan that is supposed to last for at least ten years
                        to fifteen years and cost approximately 450 million euros wich is roughly 538 million pounds sterling. The goal is to have
                        a better overall energetic efficiency, for example, consume less energy to heat the buildings, and for this they need to
                        make better wall and ceiling insulation to keep the heat inside and avoid unnecessary heating, especially the oldest
                        buildings since some of them where made in the sixties and others in the seventies. They hope to split the bill of 
                        energy consumption by 75% (electricity, water, gaz, etc ), which is a huge thing because the oldest buildings are 
                        really not in good shape, from my point of view of a student of Rennes 1, especially one of the amphitheater on the 
                        Beaulieu campus, it can be very cold in there during the winter. One the first step in this project is to start by the 
                        faculty of medicine near the CHU (university hospital center), which is allegedly supposed to start in 2023 and end in 
                        2024, it will be seven of the oldest buildings. And the buildings of the campus of Beaulieu, the number 01 to 07 where 
                        already done in autumn of 2021. The buildings that are going to be renovated on the campus of Beaulieu are the buildings 
                        number 22 to 27 as of the 14A and 15. As I am writing this in the early of march, the building number 38 is in renovation 
                        (the amphitheaters near the exam building and the building number 26), and supposed to end in the end of the summer of the 
                        year 2022. This project is a good thing for the environment, as one of the project voted by the students and the staff one 
                        year ago to plant 900 trees on the campus (with the help of MiniBigForest an organization from Nantes).

                    <p class="post_content">As you may know, planes are an ecological catastrophe. It is the most polluting means of transport that exists.
                        Aviation represents about 2% of greenhouse gas emissions of the entire world. Taking into account the average filling
                        rate and the distance travelled, the plane emits approximately 125 times more carbon dioxide than an individual
                        car and 1500 times more than a train. In addition to CO2, planes also release ozone, a greenhouse gas, and cirrus 
                        clouds (upper atmosphere clouds) which have a warming effect. However, planes are extremely useful for moving 
                        quickly anywhere in the world. That's why some airline companies are already trying to make planes fly without 
                        emitting CO2. Among them, the company Swiss International Air Lines plans to use a brand new fuel that will not
                        emit CO2 by 2023 : the synfuel solar kerosene. This fuel is created from sunlight and ambient air, which explains
                        why it does not emit CO2. Moreover this fuel is used like kerosene so it is not necessary to developpe new motors.
                        In France, an 800 million euro project has been launched to develop carbon-free planes. The goal is develop 
                        a hybrid electric or hydrogen powered plane that will be operationnal in 2030.

                    <p class="post_content">Each year, between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans. If it continues
                        like this the oceans could contain more plastic than fish by 2050. It affects all marine fauna, animals mistake small 
                        plastic fragments with food, which can lead to poisoning and cost them their lives. Also, floating waste moves in the 
                        currents and it promotes the transport of invasive species: molluscs or algae attaches themselves to this waste and end up 
                        thousands of kilometers from their place of origin. It affects fishing, the largest waste, ends up trapped in fishing nets.
                        And also tourism because the rest of the waste ends up on beaches.
                        They are some solutions like boats who collect waste, but the best way to prevent this situation is simply to not put waste in 
                        the ocean.
